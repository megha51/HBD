               Wow!! Where do I begin xD. Started of as strangers and here we are now. I Still remember you telling me that
               you thought I had attitude when we first spoke :3 (Hopefully it has changed now :P). After texting and eating 
               each other's head for over 3 months, I was super glad that we decided to meet in person. I will never forget 
               how nervous I was to meet you for the first time and how that day went. Later I felt sooooo comfortable even though 
               it was just the first time we met. And how can I forget studying with you until the watchman comes chasing us
               to go inside xD. You teaching me, me teaching you, calling each other every few hours to check our progress, waking
               each other up...lol xD. You are studying with me for this sem exam also, okay? xD And thanks for finally buying me
                that chocolate. Next time I want a beer okay? And God, how
               can I ever thank you for introducing me to TVD xD. Also, I legit hate you for not accepting that you are pretty even 
               though you are -.-  And our first chess match was damn epic okay? xD I was literally laughing at how it ended. It 
               freaks me out that I've found someone who is so similar to me in sooo many ways - from hating cheese to loving
               the music in TVD and making a playlist xD. It has been nothing but an amazing time with you so far. You're the best
                thing to happen to me this year. And like Elijah, I too wanna keep my promises to you - ALWAYS AND FOREVER

                    Everyone has that one random person they meet online and then they become an integral part of
                    your life. You are that person to me. To put it into words - 'Though there are lovely deep pearls in the sea, 
                    those treasures do not mean as much as you mean to me'

                    So this is how we started and look at where we are now xD 
                    I wish I get a friend like you in every college I study, in every city I live, on every adventure 
                    I plan to endevaour and on every path of life. Life is a beautiful journey and I'd always travel it 
                    with you. Wish you a happy birthday :)
